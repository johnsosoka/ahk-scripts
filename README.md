# AutoHotKey Scripts

## Intro

### About
Repository to house my various auto hotkey scripts. I am making these publicly available, but anybody who chooses to 
use these should be aware that I am very inexperienced with developing AHK scripts. It is extremely likely that I am
breaking AHK Standards & conventions.

### What is AutoHotKey?
AutoHotKey is a scripting language focused on controlling computer input-- Particularly keyboard key presses &
mouse clicks. 

* ‚¨áÔ∏èTo download & install AutoHotKey (required for running scripts) follow [this link](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
* üìÉ If you wish to read more about AutoHotkey in-depth then [visit here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm).



## Script Index
I grouped the scripts by application, each script will be within its own folder and include a README describing use &
function.

‚ö†Ô∏èRunning these may be a potential violation of the discord terms of service. These _could_ be considered self bots.
